## Understanding the Problem
In this world the death of people arises from day by day , so in order to control the death of people around the world we need to know the major cause of death for that a sample data set from WHO was collected , the data consists of overall death counts for the past 30 years ranging from the year 1990 to 2019 for each country along with the cause of death categorizing them in individual columns.

## Making Queries based on the Problem
Based on the Problem total of 20 queries have been created in the MySQL , based on this queries analysis is done on various comparisons.The coded queries are attached as a sql file where you can find in this repository.

## Analysing the data
After creating the queries based on the requirements , analysed the data , for understanding - the result of each query is listed as an hint which is usefull for understanding the conclusion
